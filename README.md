# What does this do?
##  The is_prime function takes a number(Integer) as an input and outputs True/False.

# How does it works?
##  This program uses the Miller-Robin primality test to verify if the number is prime or composite.
##  The proof to check primality in this program has a 0,000000954% error probability.
